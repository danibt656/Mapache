\begin{quote}
Just execute the A\+LL Makefile rule to generate the executable\+: \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make all}
\end{DoxyCode}


To clean binary files \& build directories, use\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make clean}
\end{DoxyCode}


If you have run {\ttfamily make all} and want to do {\ttfamily clean + all}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make reset}
\end{DoxyCode}


And for Valgrind checking\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ make val}
\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{I\+M\+P\+O\+R\+T\+A\+NT D\+E\+P\+E\+N\+D\+E\+N\+C\+I\+ES}}\+: you need to install the {\ttfamily libconfuse} library for parsing configuration files. You can refer to \href{https://github.com/libconfuse/libconfuse}{\texttt{ its Git\+Hub page }} for install instructions, but basically you can do well with this command (for Debian-\/based systems)\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ sudo apt install libconfuse-\/dev}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsubsection{1.\+1. How to use it?}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Through compiling, a server executable will be generated. You can then run it with\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ ./server}
\end{DoxyCode}


This will init Mapache on localhost IP, and log messages will be shown in the terminal.

Nevertheless, there are also a couple of handy flags. You can check them with {\ttfamily -\/h}\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ ./server -\/h}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{1.\+2. How to check an example?}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
This repo contains a {\ttfamily web/} folder with both the Mapache start page (for checking if it is running) and a Benchmarking page. To see the main page, just start the server and navigate to this U\+RL in your browser\+:

{\ttfamily \href{http://localhost:8080/home.html}{\texttt{ http\+://localhost\+:8080/home.\+html}}}

The benchmarking page contains several items that display the current capabilities of Mapache, along with a loading chronometer. It is hosted at\+:

{\ttfamily \href{http://localhost:8080/benchmark.html}{\texttt{ http\+://localhost\+:8080/benchmark.\+html}}}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{1.\+3 How to edit the server config file?}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
There is a server config file, called {\ttfamily server\+\_\+conf.\+conf}, which allows you to edit\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The server name ({\ttfamily server\+\_\+signature} label)
\item The root folder on which Mapache will search for your webpage files ({\ttfamily server\+\_\+root} label)
\item The port in which to listen for clients ({\ttfamily listen\+\_\+port} label)
\item Max number of clients to be connected at once ({\ttfamily max\+\_\+clients} label)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Feel free to adjust these values to your needs.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{2. F\+AQ}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}

Remember good old \href{https://httpd.apache.org/}{\texttt{ Apache Server}}? Well, I think that pretty much answers your question \+:$^\wedge$)\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{$<$em$>$\+Can I contribute to it?$<$/em$>$}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
Yes! This project is licensed with the M\+IT License, so as far as I\textquotesingle{}m concerned, it\textquotesingle{}s totally ok for you to create a pull request. I will validate your code and, if all goes okay, you will become an oficial Racoon Contributor.

{\itshape Thanks for checking this project out!}
